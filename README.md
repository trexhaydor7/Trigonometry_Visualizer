## A simple Matplotlib Trigonometry Visualizer for learning trigonometry

This project is a simple webpage that lets you visualize trigonometric functions. I used Matplotlib to design a simple user interface and to visualize the unit circle. This project is made fully in Python and utilizes both the Matplotlib and numpy library for trigonometric functions, such as sin(Œ∏), cos(Œ∏), tan(Œ∏), etc.

 * Visualize trigonometry in action
 * Scale up/down the size of grid for viewing
 * Switch between one and multiple triangles
 * Simple and easy UI with cohesive instructions
 * Text-based calculator for more precise calculations (coming soon)
